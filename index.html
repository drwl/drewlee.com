  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hi. My name is Andrew Lee. I'm a California native with a curiosity and passion for computers (computer science, engineering) and cognition (perception and perceptual learning, memory), as well as the intersection between them: AI (connectionism), human-computer interaction, and intelligent tutors.</p>
  <p>I've had the privilege of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewwlee">working at various tech-related startups</a>. Some of them have been successful and some of them have not. A few have acquired companies and a few have been acquired. My roles have been diverse, but have been centered around creating and using software to help the company excel. My professional interests lie in software engineering.</p>
  <p>In my free time, I like to watch Basketball (Warriors fan), play strategy games (currently it's Settlers of Catan), and be physically active (although I've been doing a pretty bad job lately). You might find me reading psychology research papers, hacking away on the computer, or even attending research seminars and lectures.</p>
  <p>I'm currently a student at UCLA studying Cognitive Science and Computer Science. I'm also a research assistant in Hongjing Lu's Computational Vision and Learning Lab, a member of Sigma Eta Pi, a co-ed entrepreneurship focused fraternity at UCLA, and a mentor in the Cognitive Science Student Association.</p>
