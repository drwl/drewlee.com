<p>My name is Andrew, but I also go by Drew for short.</p>

<p>I'm currently living in San Francisco and doing software engineering at <a href="https://gusto.com/about">Gusto</a>. We're building the people platform to empower businesses to be successful.</p>

<p>I grew up in the Bay Area, did my undergraduate studies at <a href="http://www.ucla.edu/about/">UCLA</a> in Cognitive Science, spent a year living and working in <a href="https://plano.gov/">Plano, TX</a>, and now I'm back home.</p>

<p>If you would like to get in touch, I prefer <a href="mailto:connect@drewlee.com?subject=Let's connect&body=Hi Andrew, I would like to connect about ...">email</a> as a method of communication.</p>

<p>Here are some things I've written over the years.</p>
