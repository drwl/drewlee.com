    <h1>Time Off in Covid</h1>
    <p><p>Monday (8/10) marked the end of my two weeks of time off. I was initially going to take the week of my birthday but ended up pushing it back further and taking an extra week off. It worked out great. The last time I took an extended amount of time away from work (extended meaning &gt; 1 week) was back in September / October 2019, before COVID. With everything that has happened since then, it felt like PTO was going to be a waste.</p>
<p>Getting out of the house made a significant impact on me. I got exposed to new stimuli and new environments. I also took large chunks of time away from devices (i.e. laptop). While I overestimated how much I could get done, over the two weeks I:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/bernal-heights-park-trail">Hiked Bernal Heights</a></li>
<li>Hiked around Point Reyes</li>
<li>Went on a road trip, seeing and hiking in Valley of Fire, Zion National Park, and Arches National Park in Moab</li>
<li>Finished reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9915.Less_Than_Zero">Less than Zero (Bret Easton Ellis)</a></li>
<li>Started going through <a href="https://cbra.info/">CBRA</a> and made good progress</li>
<li>Started reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/79352.Six_Pillars_of_Self_Esteem">Six Pillars of Self-Esteem (Nathaniel Branden)</a></li>
<li>Watched two lectures of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL22J3VaeABQApSdW8X71Ihe34eKN6XhCi">Jordan Peterson’s Personality and Its Transformations Lectures</a></li>
<li>Said goodbye and sent off a friend and former roommate. He left SF to go back home to Iowa.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reflecting on these past two weeks, I’m glad I took extended time off. I believe two weeks and longer is the proper amount of time to disconnect from work and relax. And I felt fortunate that I was able to.</p>

<h3 id="notes-to-self-for-my-next-road-trip">Notes to Self for My Next Road Trip</h3>
<ul>
<li>I underestimated how hot it was going to feel and how that would affect hiking. The weather reports said the temperature would be in the high 90s and 100s, and I thought it would be a minor inconvenience.</li>
<li>Buy the bucket hat. The Costco in Las Vegas sold bucket hats for $15.99. I regret not buying it and not having the 360° protection from the Sun.</li>
<li>I also overestimated how much time we spent driving. Our Airbnb by Zion was about an hour away from the park — as it was a lot cheaper. Making that trip to Zion and Back for two days meant we spent about 3.5 - 4 hours just driving.</li>
<li>We started our road trip by driving down to Los Angeles to pick up a friend, and I regret not flying. A friend had told me he had flown from the Bay Area to LA for cheap. Right now, Google Flights shows round trip tickets for $100 — the same cost as the gas used, and even less expensive when factoring in car depreciation and car insurance. Flying would have easily saved me 10 hours.</li>
