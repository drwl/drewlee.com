    <h1>The Awesome Winter</h1>
    <p><p>I&rsquo;m calling this period in time, &ldquo;The Awesome Winter.&rdquo; I was inspired by Phil Jackson (in The Last Dance), giving each NBA season a theme. So the theme of this period is The Awesome Winter.</p>
<p>Awesome: extremely impressive or daunting; inspiring great admiration, apprehension, or fear. (Oxford Languages)</p>
<p>Winter: as Jim Rohn puts it, &ldquo;Winter will always come; not only in the winter of cold, and wind, and ice, and snow, but the human winters of despair and loneliness, or disappointment, or tragedy.&rdquo; <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard &ldquo;The New Normal&rdquo; be passed around, but this period does not feel normal. The only normal thing, is that nothing is normal. In the Bay Area, we&rsquo;ve had closures to reopenings and back to closures, and we&rsquo;ve had protests and riots. There&rsquo;s the continual political battle for the future of the country. And now, smoke clouds are shrouding the West Coast <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>During this period, it feels like I have just been existing. Going through the motions. Days blur together. Time moves on, and yet it feels like I&rsquo;m stuck in time.</p>
<p>So giving this period in time a theme has been helpful for me. To realize and describe it for what it is. As my therapist puts it, that what we&rsquo;re going through is &ldquo;intense.&rdquo; But it&rsquo;s important to remember that &ldquo;the major challenge confronting those surrounded by winter is not to let it affect the arrival of spring, and our ability to recognize that arrival.&rdquo; <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
