    <h1>Greg Bauges: Developers and Depression (Talk)</h1>
    <p><p>I stumbled across this sometime in late 2013. At the time, I didn&rsquo;t know much about mental health, but I always felt that there was something off within me when it came to productivity and procrastination.</p>
<p>Hearing about Greg&rsquo;s journey and his experiences resonated with me, and it made an impact on my life.</p>
<p>Just give a watch, and if it doesn&rsquo;t resonate with you, perhaps it will shed light on what others may be facing and going through.</p>
